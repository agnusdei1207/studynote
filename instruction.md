## Folder Structure Rules

When creating files, follow the folder structure below and save them in the appropriate location:

```
study/
├── cs_fundamentals/          # Computer Science fundamentals
│   ├── algorithm/            # Algorithm related (sorting, searching, complexity, etc.)
│   ├── data_structure/       # Data structure related (heap, tree, graph, etc.)
│   ├── operating_system/     # Operating system related
│   └── network/              # Network related
├── programming/              # Programming language learning
│   ├── rust/
│   ├── python/
│   └── javascript/
└── devops/                   # DevOps related
    ├── docker/
    ├── kubernetes/
    └── cloud/
```

**Rules:**
1. If a folder matching the topic does not exist, create a new one.
2. Use lowercase letters and underscores (_) for file names. (e.g., `heap_data_structure.md`)
